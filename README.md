# Cafe Website

This web application is a portfolio project showcasing my ability to create a full-stack website using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It displays data about cafes with Wi-Fi and good coffee, sourced from an SQLite database (`cafes.db`). Users can view, add, and delete cafes.

## Key Features

* **View Cafes:** Displays a list of cafes from the database, including details like name, location, amenities, and coffee price.
* **Add Cafes:** Allows users to add new cafes to the database through a form.
* **Delete Cafes:** Enables users to delete cafe entries from the database.
* **Data Source:** Uses an SQLite database (`cafes.db`) to store cafe information.
* **Dynamic Content:** The website dynamically displays cafe data retrieved from the database.
* **Built with Flask:** The backend is built using the Flask web framework.
* **Database Interaction:** Uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.

## Technologies Used

* **Flask:** Python web framework for handling routes, logic, and templating.
* **SQLAlchemy:** ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for interacting with the SQLite database.
* **SQLite:** Database to store cafe data.
* **HTML:** Structures the web pages.
* **CSS:** Styles the web pages.
* **Jinja2:** Templating engine for rendering dynamic content in HTML.


## Future Improvements

* Implement user authentication.
* Add more robust error handling.
* Improve the user interface with better styling (e.g., using Bootstrap).
* Implement a more user-friendly way to update cafe details.
* Add search and filtering functionality.
